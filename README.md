# Bike_Sales_Excel

The raw dataset contains personal information, as well as whether the person was a car owner or a bike owner.

Using this, I cleaned the dataset to make it more readable. I removed duplicate entries, replaced unclear definitions such as M & S to Married & Single, made the income look cleaner, and created a new column with Age brackets.

After this, 3 simple pivot tables are created to show different data representations such as the Avg Income of people who did/did not buy a bike, divided by Gender. The pivot tables were used to create grahpical visualizations to better represent the data.

These visulizations were then added into an interactive dashboard where the user can modify the graphs based on how they choose to splice the data using different factors such as Marital Status, Region, and Education to gain meaningful insights into people who purchased bikes (or did not) to see any patterns.

The attached Excel document contains relevant sheets going through this process, with the final sheet containing the completed dashboard.
